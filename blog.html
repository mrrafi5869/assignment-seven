        <h1>3. How does javascript even loop work</h1>
        <p> <b>Ans:</b> The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. <br> If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the <br> first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. <br> Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
